# termCal
A failed attempt at designing an expression parser!


Demo at <a href="https://e-t-sudo.github.io/termCal"><https://e-t-sudo.github.io/termCal></a>
## Guide
  * Basic mathematical operators, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `^` supported for integers and floating point numbers.
  * `clear` erases the results form previous commands
  * `history` gives the previously evaluated expressions and their results
  * `dark`/`light` can be used to switch the console theme
  * `#` can be used to disable command tracking
## Todo
Although the frontend is beautiful, the underlying parser and the evaluator function is not that strong! It can only support a few basic mathematical operations for now. It needs to rewritten to support variables, functions, and perhaps <s>control statements like if-else and for loops</s>.
